			<h3>Welcome and thank you for choosing Whatcha Watchin!</h3>
			<p class="intro">
				Since this is your first time here, let us explain how this works.
				We are going to ask you to rate some movies, so that we establish your movie taste. After we have an idea of your preferences,
				our application can determine other users who have similar tastes as you, and we can then recommend a movie that those users have rated highly.
			</p>
			<p>
				To start, we are going to ask you to rate some pre-chosen movies from a specific genre, just to get you setup in our database.
				Later, you can take surveys from other genres, or even search your own movies you want to rate.
