A final project for team A of the 2018 backend bootcamp through Grand Circus GR.

this is a web application that pulls movie data from the OMBD (open movie database) and allows users to rate them. We created a SQL database that saves the users rating profile, and then allows the user to search for a specific movie, and recieve an agregate rating of that movie from users who have similar rating profiles (i.e. similar movie taste).
